# üõ†Ô∏è Express.js Product API

Welcome to the **Product Management API**, a Node.js and Express.js based backend project designed with a clean MVC architecture.  
It leverages **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for data storage, providing full CRUD operations for managing products like wheat, bats, and more!

---

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- **Entry Point**:  
  `index.js` boots the Express server, connects to MongoDB, and integrates all API routes. Server runs on port **3000**, with live-reloading powered by **Nodemon**.

- **Controllers**:  
  `product.controller.js` handles the core logic:
  - `createProduct`: Adds a new product to the database.
  - `getAllProducts`: Retrieves the entire product list.
  Both functions are built with async/await and robust error handling for smooth API operations.

- **Model**:  
  `product.model.js` defines a simple yet effective **Product Schema** with:
  - Fields: `name`, `quantity`, `price`
  - All fields are required, with automatic timestamping (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`).

- **Routes**:  
  `product.routes.js` maps HTTP methods to controller functions:
  - **POST** `/api/products`
  - **GET** `/api/products`
  - **GET** `/api/products/:id`
  - **PUT** `/api/products/:id`
  - **DELETE** `/api/products/:id`

  Structured with Express Router for modular and maintainable routing.

## üß™ API Endpoints Overview

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|:------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
| POST | `/api/products` | Create a new product |
| GET | `/api/products` | Retrieve all products |
| GET | `/api/products/:id` | Retrieve a single product by ID |
| PUT | `/api/products/:id` | Update an existing product |
| DELETE | `/api/products/:id` | Delete a product by ID |

Each endpoint returns structured JSON responses with appropriate status codes (`200 OK`, etc.).
